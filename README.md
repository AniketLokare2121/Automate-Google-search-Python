# Automate-Google-search-Python

<p align='left'> The Automated Google Search project aims to create a Python script that allows users to perform Google searches programmatically. By leveraging the power of Python and the Google search engine, this tool will enable users to retrieve search results, extract relevant information, and analyze data automatically. </p>

<b>What I Used:
<br>
1. tkinter (Python Library) - for the interface.<br>
2. webbrowser (module) - to open a web URL in broweser.<br>
3. googlsearch (Python Library) - to search google.<br>
4. Pycharm IDE (Community)<br>
</b>
<br>
<b>Project Description:</b><br>
The project will consist of building a command-line Python script that interacts with the Google search engine through automated web scraping techniques. The script will take user-defined search queries as input and return a list of search results, along with any specified information such as titles, URLs, snippets, or other relevant data.<br>
<br>
<b>Key Features:</b>
User Input: The script will prompt the user to enter the search query they wish to perform on Google.

Web Scraping: The project will employ web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to access and extract search results from Google's search results pages.

Search Result Parsing: The retrieved search results will be parsed to extract essential information, including titles, URLs, and snippets, from each search result.
